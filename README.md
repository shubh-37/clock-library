# clock library
This library allows you to display real time clock on your application without any hassle.
You can specify the format in which you want to display the clock as one of the props.
You can check out the various format from moment(https://momentjscom.readthedocs.io/en/latest/moment/04-displaying/01-format/) and pass it as it. 

Next you also have to pass a delay timer as one of the props in order to refresh your clock. 
By default it will refresh every 1 sec.
